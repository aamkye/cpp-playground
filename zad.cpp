// 1. Implement a template function IsDerivedFrom() that takes class C and class P as template parameters.
// It should return true when class C is derived from class P and false otherwise.

// 2. Implement a template boolean IsSameClass() that takes class A and B as template parameters.
// It should compare class A and B and return false when they are different classes and true if they are the same class.

// 3. Implement a void function F that takes pointers to two arrays of integers (A and B) and a size N as parameters.
// It then populates B where B[i] is the product of all A[j] where j != i.
// For example: if A = {2, 1, 5, 9}, then B would be {45, 90, 18, 10}

// 4. Implement functionality for train wagon composition.
// For example: if attached wagon 'a' from left, then wagon 'b' from right, and then wagon c from left
// after detaching two wagons from right wagon 'c' should be present.

// 5. Implement palindrome function that return true if word is palindrome or false if it's not.
// For example: dad => true; daad => true; dada => false
